# LEMP Wordpress

Create a local environment for quickly test Wordpress websites.

Includes:
- Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty
- Nginx 1.4.6
- PHP 5.6
- MySQL 5.5
- Wordpress (latest)

> If you want use Apache instead of nginx, you might check this repository: https://github.com/minimalart/lamp-wordpress

## Requirements
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
- [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html)

## Installation
1. Install Virtualbox, Vagrant and Ansible
2. Install [Vagrant::Hostupdater](https://github.com/cogitatio/vagrant-hostsupdater) plugin
```
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
```

3. Clone repository into a desired folder
```
$ git clone https://github.com/minimalart/lemp-wordpress.git
```

4. Move to repository folder
```
$ cd lemp-wordpress
```
You will ask for your machine admin password to update host file.

5. (Optional) Customize local ip

  If you use the default box, no configuration should be required to get up and running.
  However if you want to use an IP address other than ```192.168.100.101```, replace that address with the one you wish to use in `Vagrantfile (line 8)`

6. Run the commands below:
  ```
  $ vagrant up
  ```
  The setup will take some time to finish. In the meantime, you can have a [sword fight](http://xkcd.com/303/).

7. Browse to [http://lemp-wordpress.local](http://lemp-wordpress.local) and enjoy.
8. You can login to the WP Admin Panel in [http://lemp-wordpress.local/wp-admin](http://lemp-wordpress.local/wp-admin) with user: `wpadmin` and password: `wppass`

#### Tips and Hints:

* All users and passwords for accesing WP Admin Panel are located in ***ansible/settings.yml*** file.
* You can `ssh` into the VM with `vagrant ssh` command, with no password.
* ***WP-CLI*** is installed, so you can run `wp` commands as described in [http://wp-cli.org/](http://wp-cli.org/)
